# FontAnatomy
KSA 2021 Graduation research conducted by 19-124 Jeuk Hwang

# Progress
## DrawGlyph
Input the size and string  
Show glyphs with chosen size and string  
Indicate the indirect and direct points  
Indicate the edge of glyphs

### Plan
- Get approximate area of besier curve  
The equation must be difficult unless using approximation

- Get contrast

- Some data about vertical position

## Shortest Distance
Copy the code from others
Should be integrated with Drawglyph

# Limitation
단순히 glyph 모양 뿐만 아니라 이들의 vertical position도 font에 큰 영향을 준다
이와 관련된 단어가 많은 것이 이를 방증
